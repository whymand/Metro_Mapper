# Metro_Mapper
Metropolitan Area Mapping Tool: A shinyApp that allows user to upload a metro area -level or county -level .csv dataset and instantaneously generate a customizable chloropleth map.


### metro_mapper.R
runs the app (server and UI). 

### report.Rmd
generates a publication-ready customized map (this file is knitted to html when a button is clicked by the user within the app)
NOTE: will not run because Brookings logo not uploaded publicly

### metro_coder.Rmd
generates code that can be copied and pasted into a blank .Rmd file that would produce the map generated within the app (this file is knitted to html when a button is clicked by the user within the app)
NOTE: will not run because Brookings logo not uploaded publicly
